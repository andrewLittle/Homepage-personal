			It's something I've been doing for a while now and I'm lucky to have found a challenge that I love waking up to every morning. I currently work with an amazing team at a large e-commerce site, but I'm always looking for new opportunities to hone and expand my knowledge and skills. I'm mainly a developer with a base of HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQuery, but I've played around with front end [need word] Ruby, Slim, Flight, PHP, as well as Java, C++, and SQL. Design and UX is what I'm most interested in getting better at so I can participate in all aspects of the conversation. More information about what I'm currently doing can be found on my <a href="#" class="blog">blog</a>.
